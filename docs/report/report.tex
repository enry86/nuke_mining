\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a framework useful for the comparison between
classification algorithms.
The main evaluation measures used are time used for building the
classification structure, space consumed by the structure and the accuracy
of the classification provided.
The example provided here is the evaluation of the performances of a
generic decision tree and the Random Decision Tree algorithm by Wei Fan.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
The main objective of this work is to measure and compare the performances
of different classification algorithms. In particular we have focused on
the Random Decision Tree algorithm, comparing its performances with a
decision tree based on Information Gain.
